# [Project 1](https://github.com/Jyothif/Predicting-_Student-Score_Linear-Regression)

# **Student Score Prediction**

Predict the percentage of marks of an student based on the number of study hours by using simple linear regression task.
* Linear Regression is machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.
* It performs regression task,regression models target prediction value on independent variables.
* Its the relationship between dependent and independent variables,number of independent variable being used

# Project 2
This project combination of two data sets with different types of "Data Exploration Techniques"

# [Superheros Data Exploration](https://github.com/Jyothif/Superhero_Data_Exploration)

* Super Heroes have been in popular culture for a long time and now more than ever. Since its creation, super heroes have not been very diverse, but that is changing rapidly, an overview about heroes and their physical as well as power characteristics, helping researchers and curious minds identify trends and patterns.

# [Heart Disease Data Exploration](https://github.com/Jyothif/Heart-Disease-)
The goal here is to find out more about the data and become a subject matter export on the dataset you're working with.

* What question(s) are you trying to solve?
* What kind of data do we have and how do we treat different types?
* What's missing from the data and how do you deal with it?
* Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?
* How can you add, change or remove features to get more out of your data?

# [Project 3](https://github.com/Jyothif/k-means-clustering_iris-dataset)
* It mainly delas with finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data.
* For this IRIS data set I am using k-Means clustering algorithm.
* k-menas clustering: A k-Means Clustering algorithm tries to group similar items in the form of clusters.The No.of groups is represented by 'k'

# [Project 4](https://github.com/Jyothif/Cars-Sales-Prediction)

car’s make and model type may affect its price quite significantly. In order to determine is a car is overpriced or not, we ran the classifier without these features. The most overpriced cars are found to be the ones with the greatest difference between its projected price (by the algorithm) and its actual price (the testing values). In addition to individual models, we took a look at the most overpriced brands.

The results do not disappoint; indeed it seems that the most overpriced brands are those that sell ridiculously priced cars that everyone wants to buy but don’t have the money for it

# [Project 5](https://github.com/Jyothif/Ecommerce-customer-device-usage_LR)

There was a time mobile devices were primarily used for making telephone calls. Nowadays, mobile devices are ubiquitous and are used for a variety of purposes. From finding transportation to doing taxes, mobile app solutions have been growing at an exponential rate. One of the fastest growing mobile app verticals is eCommerce. In fact, eMarketer forecasts that the global eCommerce revenue will rise 19% in 2020 to $4.206 trillion (up from $3.535 trillion in 2019). By 2021, they expect global eCommerce revenue will approach $5 trillion.

As the Linear Regression project, I have implemented the best fit line by cross examine using MAE,MSE,RMSE
