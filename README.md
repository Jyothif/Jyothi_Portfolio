# [Project 3](https://github.com/Jyothif/k-means-clustering_iris-dataset)
* It mainly delas with finding a structure or pattern in a collection of uncategorized data.
* For this IRIS data set I am using k-Means clustering algorithm.
* k-menas clustering: A k-Means Clustering algorithm tries to group similar items in the form of clusters.The No.of groups is represented by 'k'
